# sklearn_plugins

Currently only has Spherical KMeans.

Mimic the structure of official scikit-learn package.

As I work through my ML project, if there are some algorithms that are not implemented, I will add it to this repository.

I attempt to follow scikit-learn developer guidlines, but some rules might still break some rules for convenience reason.
