class SphericalKMeans(BaseEstimator, ClusterMixin, TransformerMixin):
    """Spherical K-Means Clustering.

    An implementation of spherical K-Means clustering based on Coats and Ng, "Learning Feature Representations with K-Means", 2012.

    Input flow:
    ```pseudo
        if normalize:
            __normalizer.fit_transform(x)
        if standarize:
            __std_scalar.fit_transform(x)
        __pca.fit_transform(x)
        perform_kmeans(x)
    ```

    Attributes:
        n_clusters (int, optional): The number of clusters to form as well as the number of centroids to generate.. Defaults to 500.
        n_components (Union[int, float, str, None], optional): Number of components to keep after PCA. If n_components is not set all components are kept. Defaults to 0.8.
        normalize (bool, optional): Normalize features within individual sample to zero mean and unit variance prior to training. Defaults to True.
        standarize (bool, optional): Standarize individual features across dataset to zero mean and unit variance after normalization prior to whitening. Defaults to True.
        whiten (bool, optional): When True, the components_ vectors are multiplied by the square root of n_samples and then divided by the singular values to ensure uncorrelated outputs with unit component-wise variances. Defaults to True.
        max_iter (int, optional): Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run.. Defaults to 100.
        tol (float, optional): Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare convergence. Defaults to 0.01.
        copy (bool, optional): When True, the data are modified in-place. Defaults to True.
